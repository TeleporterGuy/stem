# Skills

← [Stem guide](../../README.md) · [Tools](README.md)

Examples only. These skills are not bundled with Stem.

| Example skill | Reusable procedure |
| --- | --- |
| `food-ordering` | Rebuild a usual order; verify items, address, and total; stop before checkout |
| `agent-browser-vercel` | Smoke-test a Vercel deployment with an existing agent-browser setup |
| `monthly-invoice-report` | Reconcile invoice data; total the month; flag missing or overdue invoices |
| `standup-meeting-report` | Turn standup notes into completed work, next steps, owners, and blockers |

Skills are reusable procedures: when to use a workflow, its steps, and how to verify
the result. Not memories. They provide no accounts, tools, or permissions by
themselves.

Open **Tools → Skills**.

<!-- TODO(screenshot): Skills list showing the four demo skills, an auto label, usage details, and enabled switches. -->

## What you can do

- Use the switch to disable a skill without deleting it.
- Click a skill to select it, then the trash button under the list deletes it for
  good — it asks first. This works on skills you wrote yourself too: on a server
  install the skills folder is on the server, so this is the only way to reach it.
- **Tidy up** keeps one skill per job: it splits a skill that grew to cover several
  unrelated jobs, merges two write-ups of the same job, and archives ones untouched
  for 90 days. Archiving is the same reversible switch as above, so an archived
  skill can be switched back on. Anything it rewrites is backed up first.
- **Saving skills** decides how much Stem may save on its own. Asking it to save
  one always works, whichever you pick.
- **Skills model** does the model-driven skills work: writing, `/learn`, tidy-up.
  It is also under **Settings → Models → Judgment work**.

An **auto** label marks a skill Stem created. Usage details show whether it is still
useful. Stem reshapes only skills that were its own idea, including ones you accepted
from a proposal card; it may change or split those without asking. Skills you asked it
to save, skills you imported or added yourself, `/learn` skills and recorded skills are
never rewritten by tidy-up, and Stem changes them only when you ask.

A cloud curator receives relevant chat excerpts during collection and auto-skill text
during upkeep. It may use provider quota.

Keep skills narrow and verifiable. Disable an auto skill to stop Stem using it.

## Recording a skill

Recording is in **Alpha**. On the Mac app, press **Record** under the message box
(or type `/record`, or ⌃⌥R) and do the task in your own apps as usual; press **Stop** when done. Stem
notes what you click, type and switch to, plus the settings of any dialog you
confirm, and writes a draft skill card in the chat. It may ask up to three
questions in the card; answer in a sentence. **Save skill** adds it to your library.

**Practice run** lets Stem try the draft first. It fills the message box with the
task and the final steps it must stop and ask about; edit it, then send. Correct it
in the chat as it goes. Taking over the mouse or keyboard (or pressing Stop on a
browser run) stops it at once, and the card asks what went wrong. Afterwards, **Update
the skill from this run** rewrites the draft from what happened, your corrections
first.

Nothing is recorded inside password managers or password fields, and one-time codes,
card numbers and keys typed anywhere are masked. While recording, Stem minimizes
itself and a small pill with **Stop** stays on screen.

## Seeing a skill in use

Stem decides which skills to load by comparing your message with each skill's
description and with a few example requests it writes for every skill in the
background, in the languages you write in. When a description changes, its examples
are written again. While Memory is off, no examples are written and skills are matched
on their descriptions alone.

Under the reply, the folded tool line counts skills separately — "Used 2 tools and 1
skill". A skill is listed there only when the answer actually followed it ("Followed
the skill monthly-invoice-report"); one that was merely loaded, or only known by name,
is not. A skill already used earlier in the same chat is not loaded again.

The **used N×** figure on the Skills list is a different, stricter count: it credits a skill only
when the turn ran something the skill's steps name.

## Skills and the machine they run on

A skill is followed later, possibly somewhere else: your library travels with Stem when you
move it to a server, and a step that worked on your own Mac may then run on a machine that
cannot reach the same files, the same home network, or the same sites. Stem is told which
machine it is on when it writes a skill, and a procedure that depends on one is written down
with the machine, the reason, and the way in — `run_command`'s `device` parameter, or an MCP
server pinned to that computer. If a skill you wrote by hand needs a particular machine, say
so in its steps for the same reason.
