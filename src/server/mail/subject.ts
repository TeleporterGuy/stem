// Naming a mail conversation. A mail composed without a subject is named from
// its body's first line (shared/mail-subject deriveMailSubject), which is the
// user's own prompt cut at 60 characters — a long sentence repeating what the
// first mail already says. Once the first reply lands, the same small model
// that writes chat subjects names the conversation in two to six words.
//
// The rule chat naming lives by holds here too: only a subject Stem made up is
// ours to replace. That is a subject still equal to what the first user mail
// derives to (or the shrug), recognised by recomputing the derivation — there
// is no stored fingerprint to consult, and none is needed. A subject the user
// typed, a forwarded mail's "Fwd: …" and a scheduled task's headline all differ
// from it; task conversations are skipped outright, because each firing retitles
// them on purpose. Private conversations are named like private chats are: the
// naming call learns nothing and keeps nothing.
//
// Conversations that predate this get one sweep, the first time a signed-in
// server comes up on this version: newest first, one call at a time, at most
// PASS_CAP of them. The store remembers the sweep finished, so it never repeats
// (one cut short by a restart picks up the rest next boot), and a call that
// fails simply leaves that conversation with the name it had.
