// Naming a thread. pi never names a session, so Stem always has to; the cheap
// answer is the first line the user typed (autoTitle, below), and the good one
// is a subject a small model writes from the conversation itself.
//
// A name written from the opening message alone is wrong twice over: a thread
// that opens with "look at this" has no topic in it yet, and a thread named at
// turn 1 keeps that name through forty turns of drifting somewhere else. So the
// naming pass runs on a widening schedule (NAMING_GAPS) — once the first reply
// has landed, then more and more rarely — and every run after the first shows
// the model the name it already has and only what has been said since. That
// keeps names stable by default: the old name carries the thread's history
// forward, so a re-check reads as the whole thread without re-reading it.
//
// The one thing the schedule may never do is overwrite a name the user typed.
// `stillOurs` is the guard: a thread is ours to rename only while it still
// carries the exact name we last gave it (or pi's placeholder, or the first line
// of the opening message). Anything else the user chose, and the thread is
// theirs from then on.
