// The server's half of the OAuth callback courier.
//
// Every loopback OAuth flow on this server — pi's provider logins, the MCP
// authorization in ./oauth.ts — binds 127.0.0.1 *here* and waits for the browser
// to arrive. That is correct on a desktop, where the browser is on this machine,
// and quietly impossible once the server lives on a VPS: the user's browser
// resolves 127.0.0.1 to the laptop it is running on, the callback lands on a
// port nothing on that machine is listening to, and the sign-in hangs until it
// times out with no error to show for it.
//
// So the client catches the callback instead (src/desktop/oauth-courier.ts) and
// hands it back over the transport, and this file replays it to the loopback
// listener the flow already has open. pi completes believing it caught the
// browser itself, which is the point: nothing in a provider flow has to know
// that the browser was on another continent.
//
// The registry below is what keeps that from being a request-forgery primitive.
// A delivery is only replayed to an address that a flow ON THIS SERVER announced
// in the last ten minutes, with the `state` that flow expects — so an
// authenticated client cannot use this channel to make the server fetch loopback
// addresses of its choosing, and a callback that belongs to no live sign-in is
// refused rather than forwarded to whatever happens to be listening.
