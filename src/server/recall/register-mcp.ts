 * fallback (a lone .ts file can't be spawned). At runtime this module executes
 * from dist/main, so a sibling join resolves the built artifact. Packaged builds
 * ship without asar (see electron-builder.yml) precisely so this — and every
 * other ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE child — stays spawnable as a real file.
