// The one-time migration question, asked once per user and never again.

// Skills written before the rebuild cannot be carried forward (see
// server/skills/reset.ts for why), so this dialog is not a choice about whether —
// it is where the user is told what is happening, gets the chance to keep a
// readable copy, and answers the one question the rebuild newly needs an answer
// to: how automatic saving should be from now on.
//
// There is deliberately no Cancel, no Escape-to-close and no backdrop dismissal.
// The old library is unusable either way; a "later" button would delete the same
// files tomorrow and only buys a second showing of this dialog.

// Same three labels as the Skills tab's mode picker. One vocabulary for one
// setting — a user who meets it here and again in Settings must not have to work
// out that "Ask first" and some second phrasing are the same thing.
